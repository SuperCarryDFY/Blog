Always appears when I&amp;rsquo;m reading current papers. So I decide to write down the most important parts (most concerned by myself, in other way)in the papers&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is a pretty well-known work from CVPR2016, which has got 6.5k citation numbers up-to-date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are 2 parts seems to be important to me: &lt;strong>comparison between global max pooling and global average pooling&lt;/strong>, as well as &lt;strong>weakly-supervised object localization&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="gmp-vs-gap">GMP vs. GAP&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We believe that GAP loss encourages the network to identify the extent of the object as compared to GMP which encourages it to identify just one discriminative part.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>while GMP achieves similar classification performance as GAP, GAP outperforms GMP for localization.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>GAP can focus on a wide range of pixels while GMP only depends on the most significant feature.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="weakly-supervised-object-localization">Weakly-supervised Object Localization&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>They meant weakly-supervised because the labels is image-level but localization is object-level&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
