# About

Hey, welcome to Dai Fengyuan's blog!

I am an undergraduate student from SHU, majoring in Computer Science. 

Fortunately, I am doing internship jobs at Milab, Westlake University simultaneously. 

At present, my concerned field is Few-Shot Learning and Segmentation. 

I built this website mainly because I needed the motivation to write down the key point of the paper I had read. If I have any ideas later, I will post them here.

Later the website will support a comment system, so you can leave your idea here.

If you want to contact me, please email me at da1cantst0p@gmail.com or find me on Wechat. My Wechat ID is DaiBaoSuperrrr (please indicate purpose)
