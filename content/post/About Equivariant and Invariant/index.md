## Define Equivariance

![Defination](fig_1.png)

Then the Translation, Rotation, Permutation equivariance can be defined as followes:

## Define Invariance

Similar to equivariance, invariance meas after a function, the output remains invariance when the input performs translation, rotation or permutation. 

PS. the input and output can be features.
